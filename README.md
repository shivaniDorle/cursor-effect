# Sparkle Mouse Effect

This simple web application creates a sparkling effect following the movement of the mouse cursor. Each movement generates a small particle that sparkles and fades out after a short period of time.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

Move your mouse cursor around the screen to see the sparkling effect follow its movement. The particles will appear at the cursor position and fade out after a short animation.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the particles and their behavior by modifying the `style.css` and `script.js` files:

- **style.css**: Contains the styles for the particles and the overall appearance of the webpage.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript code responsible for generating and animating the particles.

Feel free to experiment with different colors, sizes, or animation properties to create your own unique effect!
